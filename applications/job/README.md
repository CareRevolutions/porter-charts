# Job

Jobs are one-off processes that run to completion. It's best suited for ephemeral tasks such as database migration or clean up scripts.

You can choose to run a job only once or periodically on a schedule specified as a cron expression. Please see [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) for a quick guide on cron expressions. To create cron expressions more easily, try this [online editor for cron schedule expressions](https://crontab.guru/).
