[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a hosted infrastructure monitoring platform. This chart adds the Datadog Agent to all nodes in your cluster via a DaemonSet. It also optionally depends on the [kube-state-metrics chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/tree/master/charts/kube-state-metrics). For more information about monitoring Kubernetes with Datadog, please refer to the [Datadog documentation website](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/basic_agent_usage/kubernetes/).

Datadog [offers two variants](https://hub.docker.com/r/datadog/agent/tags/), switch to a `-jmx` tag if you need to run JMX/java integrations. The chart also supports running [the standalone dogstatsd image](https://hub.docker.com/r/datadog/dogstatsd/tags/).

See the [Datadog JMX integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/java/) to learn more.
