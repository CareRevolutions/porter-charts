      label: This installs the LogDNA agent, which forwards all logs from Porter to
        LogDNA for ingestion. It may take around 30 minutes for the logs to arrive
        in your LogDNA instance. Be aware that this incurs additional cost based on
        your retention settings. By default, all logs are ingested - to reduce costs,
        you can filter out the logs from LogDNA.
